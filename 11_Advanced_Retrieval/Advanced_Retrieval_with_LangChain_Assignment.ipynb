        "\n",
        "1. We split the full document into large \"parent\" chunks (e.g. 2000 characters).\n",
        "2. Each parent chunk is further split into smaller \"child\" chunks (e.g. 400 characters).\n",

        "The basic idea is:\n",

        "- **Return** big chunks (richer surrounding context)\n",

Good sleep quality is crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, managing stress, and preventing chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and mental health issues.
