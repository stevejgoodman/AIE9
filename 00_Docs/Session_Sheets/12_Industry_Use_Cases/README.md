# 🗺️ Overview

Welcome to the middle of the course!  We’re 5 weeks in, and we’ve covered a lot of ground - you all certainly have enough prototyping skill to be dangerous!

At this point, it’s important to consider everything in front of us as a blank page - blue sky!

It’s time to align the general skills we’ve learned (and will continue to learn!) in the specific direction aligned with what you’re aiming at.

What are your goals for the rest of 2025 and into 2026?

How can you build 🏗️, ship 🚢, and share 🚀 your way towards achieving them?

It all starts now, with the Certification Challenge, which is the next step towards continuing your journey to Demo Day!

💡

Remember, *you know enough already to be dangerous*. You already know enough of the concepts and code you need to build, ship, and share production AI applications!

And this is what the Certification challenge is all about - putting **your skills to the tes**t!

# Setting Expectations

During Cohort 8, here is how the numbers shook out. It took an average of 26.2 hours for people to complete the challenge. This is up slightly from 23.2 hours on average in Cohort 7.

It’s very much worth considering that the kind of AI Engineering work we’re doing; that is, scoping a problem, creating a solution to that problem that solves a specific pain point for real customers or stakeholders, and engineering it for scale from day 1, is extremely valuable work.

In our opinion, **this is the kind of pilot project work that you should be charging $5-20k as a solo consultant**.

It is also the kind of work that, after you take a few shots on goal, will become faster and faster for you to knock out.

Finally, it’s worth noting that [Certified AI Engineers](https://aimakerspace.io/graduates/) not only are at the top of hiring lists within our network, but we’ve worked with multiple former students & solo consultants in the past to fill up their plate with project work, and we’ve helped certified students running startups to build out their teams.

What is in your future as an AI Engineer or AI Engineering Leader?
