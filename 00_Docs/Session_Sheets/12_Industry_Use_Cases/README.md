# What Not To Build

What should you build today, and why? The first way to answer a "what should you do" question is to answer its logical opposite. It's much easier...

You should NOT:

- Build anything that ChatGPT or Claude can do out of the box
- Focus on building things with only publicly available data
- Think that vibe coding a frontend can differentiate your application
- Forget about the cycles of conversation turns and the role of memory in user experience
- Forget to add "agents" to your idea when selling it (even if it is simply using a simple agentic search or RAG tool)
- Cast aside _your specific industry expertise_
- Fail to plan for a positive feedback loop of usage -> data from usage -> better performance -> more usage -> more data -> better ...
- Recreate _any wheels_ from scratch that you can get off the shelf

# 🕴️ Industry Use Cases

ROI now. More pilots now. More of them in production now.

In 2026, enterprises are competing more than ever. They want to win in the marketplace. They want to defeat their competition and capture the market. They need people like you to help them do it.

In 2026, even big governments in the U.S. and around the world are saying that the time is NOW to implement AI projects. No one starts a talk at a conference and asks, "Raise your hand if you've used ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude?!" Even the safest industries are moving faster than ever and trying to make "fail fast - it's OK" part of their AI strategy.

The keyword last year for those building at the edge was something like `productivity`.

The keyword this year goes further; it's something like `agentic AI leadership`. Companies want to go beyond simple productivity hacks and automations into a space of more transformational change.

As we've learned, a Deep Research system is a multi-agent system. We can build these ourselves and tailor them to our use cases. Just 18 months ago, building a system like this _was transformational change_. The number 1 use case for agents was research and summarization, according to LangChain’s 2024 [State of AI Agents](https://www.langchain.com/stateofaiagents). This capability to search and re-search has now been built into all of the leading LLM products.

Going up a level, we might ask: where do we plug a deep research tool into a workflow that exists in our organization? How might we tailor it to our company or use case? 

We're moving beyond _single employees that do more_ to _smaller teams that do more_.

If product management tactics can be implemented 10x faster, and code - whether backend or frontend can be written 10-100x faster - why do we need a ton of people to do big things?

The answer is that we don't. We can go beyond productivity with agentic AI, _properly wielded by everyone in our organization_.

The caveat of trying to do more transformational things with agents is that there are risks. These risks exist on both the business and technical sides.

If we, as AI Engineers, can help manage those risks, the ROI and upside for our companies (and for us!) can be quite large.

## How Things Have Been Going

From LangChain's State of AI Engineering (Jan 2026)

>Key findings:
> - **Production momentum is real**, with 57% of respondents having agents in production, with large enterprises leading in adoption
> - **Quality is the production killer**, with 32% citing it as a top barrier. Meanwhile, cost concerns dropped from last year
> - **Observability is table stakes**. Nearly 89% of respondents have implemented observability for their agents, outpacing evals adoption at 52%.
> - Using **multiple models is the norm**. OpenAI leads with their GPT models but Gemini, Claude, and open source models see significant adoption. Fine-tuning has not been widely adopted.

We're hearing things like "Coding is largely solved" from the [Head of Claude Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We7BZVKbCVw).

As [KPMG put it](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/q2-ai-pulse-2025-agents-move-beyond-experimentation.html) in June of 2025: “AI-agent strategies are moving past the experimentation phase,” and that “AI-agents transition from tools to teammates.” They also noted that “ROI focus shifts amid data challenges and need for broad expertise.” *This means that ROI and scoping business problems worth solving is more important than ever*, and a far cry from May 2024 when McKinsey broke the business-value issue down in one sentence: “[Gen AI starts to generate value](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai).” 

It seems that KPMG captured the zeitgeist quite well at that time - the transition from hype to real business value is upon us.

We have Deep Research, we have Claude Code, we have other crazy things on the horizon. 

More practically, Generative AI tools are being rolled out as organizational resources everywhere. The tools are available to humans, but which humans will put them to work, help the companies develop a competitive edge? In 2026, we have 10x marketing managers, 10x product managers, 10-100x software engineers & data scientists. What will you be?

# What Opus 4.6 Says
The real story of 2026 is the collision between agentic ambition and operational reality.

**The Agentic Wave Is Real — But Meeting Friction**

Gartner predicts [40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by 2026](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-08-26-gartner-predicts-40-percent-of-enterprise-apps-will-feature-task-specific-ai-agents-by-2026-up-from-less-than-5-percent-in-2025), up from less than 5% in 2025. A [2026 Process Optimization Report](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260204723950/en/The-Enterprise-AI-Reality-Check-High-Ambitions-Meet-Operational-Barriers) surveying over 1,600 global business leaders found 85% of organizations want to be an "agentic enterprise" within three years, and 90% are already using or exploring multi-agent systems. Forrester predicts enterprise applications will [move beyond enabling employees with digital tools to accommodating a digital workforce of AI agents](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2026-ai-agents-changing-business-models-and-workplace-culture-impact-enterprise-software/).

**But the ROI Reckoning Has Arrived**

MIT's *GenAI Divide* research found a [95% failure rate for enterprise generative AI projects](https://www.cio.com/article/4114010/2026-the-year-ai-roi-gets-real.html), defined as not having shown measurable financial returns within six months. Forrester predicts enterprises will [defer 25% of planned AI spending into 2027](https://medium.com/@Lisamedrouk/2026-ai-predictions-what-gartner-forrester-and-idc-reveal-for-tech-leaders-96cbe36b7985), as fewer than one-third currently link initiatives to tangible financial growth. Gartner predicts that [over 40% of agentic AI projects will be scrapped by 2027](https://www.kore.ai/blog/ai-agents-in-2026-from-hype-to-enterprise-reality) — not because the models fail, but because organizations struggle to operationalize them.

**The Gap Between Ambition and Execution Is Stark**

Deloitte's 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study shows that while 30% of organizations are exploring agentic options and 38% are piloting solutions, [only 14% have solutions ready to deploy, and a mere 11% are actively using them in production](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html). Meanwhile, [76% of organizations admit their current processes are holding them back](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260204723950/en/The-Enterprise-AI-Reality-Check-High-Ambitions-Meet-Operational-Barriers), and 82% of decision-makers believe AI will fail to deliver ROI if it doesn't understand how the business actually runs.

**Governance Is Becoming Non-Negotiable**

Forrester predicts [60% of Fortune 100 companies will appoint a head of AI governance in 2026](https://www.ciodive.com/news/5-cio-predictions-for-ai-in-2026/807951/). Gartner's strategic predictions warn that ["death by AI" legal claims will exceed 2,000 by the end of 2026](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/strategic-predictions-for-2026) due to insufficient risk guardrails. Adding urgency, the [EU AI Act reaches full application to high-risk systems in August 2026](https://www.joneswalker.com/en/insights/blogs/ai-law-blog/ten-ai-predictions-for-2026-what-leading-analysts-say-legal-teams-should-expect.html), with penalties reaching €35 million or 7% of global revenue.

**Where Agents *Are* Delivering Value**

Agents are becoming mainstream in [constrained, well-governed domains such as IT operations, employee service, finance operations, onboarding, and support workflows](https://www.kore.ai/blog/ai-agents-in-2026-from-hype-to-enterprise-reality) — environments that tolerate human-in-the-loop, have clear boundaries, and deliver fast ROI. At one global logistics company, [AI reduced a 30-to-40-person group down to four or five people](https://research.etr.ai/etr-data-drop/enterprise-ai-trends-2026-how-leaders-measure-roi-and-risk) by automating 80–90% of operational workflows.

**The Bottom Line**

The market is shifting from ["what can AI do?" to "what does AI cost, and can we prove its value?"](https://i10x.ai/news/ai-predictions-2026-shift-to-efficiency-governance). If 2025 was the year of realizing that generative AI has a value-realization problem, [2026 will be the year of doing something about it](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-trends-in-ai-and-data-science-for-2026/).

**Keyword**: agentic AI

**Theme**: the transition from experimentation to operationalization — proving real ROI, scaling with governance, and surviving the reality check.
